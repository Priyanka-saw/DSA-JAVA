- Recursion 
- when a function call itself is known as the recursion

- while the funtion is not finished executing, it will remain in stack
- when a function finishes executing, it is removed from stack, and the flow of program is stoped

- why recursion
- because it helps us solving bigger /complex problems in a simple way
- we convert the recursion solution into iteration and vise versa
- space complexity is not constant because of recursive calls
