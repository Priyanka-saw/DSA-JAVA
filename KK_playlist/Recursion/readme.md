- Recursion 
- when a function call itself is known as the recursion

- while the funtion is not finished executing, it will remain in stack
- when a function finishes executing, it is removed from stack, and the flow of program is stoped

- why recursion
- because it helps us solving bigger /complex problems in a simple way
- we convert the recursion solution into iteration and vise versa
- space complexity is not constant because of recursive calls

- viualising recursion(recursion tree)
-   


- how to understand and approach the problem?
- identify if we can break the problem into smaller problem
- write the recurion relation if needed 
- draw the recursion tree
- about the tree-->
- 1.see the flow of function how they are in stack
- 2. identify and focus on left left tree calls and right tree calls
- see how the value is returning at each step, see where the function call  will come out , in the end , we will come out of the main function


- types of the recurence relation 
- 1. Linear recurence relation eg - (fibonacci number)eg
- 2. divide and conqure recurence relations - (binary search)eg (fast and efficent)

-tip to solve recusrion 
- do not overthink
